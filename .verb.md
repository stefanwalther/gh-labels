## Purpose

This repository acts as a central repository to provide definitions for GitHub labels, which then can be loaded by a GitHub action to apply the same set of labels to one or more repositories.

Labels are managed in the various branches of this repo.

This works perfectly in combination with the [gh-labels-action](https://github.com/julbme/gh-action-manage-label) GitHub action (or similar ones).
